##Character Extraction
Character extraction based on OpenCV and OCR
No machine learning used for extraction here

## Problems
Not effective with all writing policies
To many problems, but I wanted to try
Way better to go to a ML method to find characters in an image as for example a moving frame around the image that would feed a NN which would tell if there's a character in this frame.
