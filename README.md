## Character Extraction
Character extraction based on OpenCV and OCR
No machine learning used for extraction here
But machine learning will be used for char recognition

Still in progress to be more readable

## Problems
Not effective with all writing policies.

To many problems, but I wanted to try.

Way better to go for a ML method in order to find characters in an image. 

A good method would be for example to move a frame around the image. 
The content of this frame would then feed a NN which would tell if there's a character or not.
If there's a character, the content of the frame would be stored to be analyzed by another NN to determine which character it is.
